# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We have a real dataset on crowdfunding carried out by the company Kickstarter during the years 2019 to 2017.
This exercise consists of a simulation where we help a person to obtain through an analysis, the clues to obtain a successful crowdfunding campaign .
It is important to follow the behavior of successful trends in order not to err in our purpose.

### Purpose
Through this simulation, we get into the basics of data analysis. We use observation to understand what our dataset is all about, the changes we need to make to get it clean, add filters, conditionals and data formatting, adding filters, conditionals and data formatting.
Then we get into more specialized topics such as measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and measures of spread, standard deviation, variance, range and quartiles.

## Analysis and Challenges
Statistical analysis will provide us with the basis for eliminating this analysis of sensations and basing ourselves on scientific analysis. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Definitely what I found most challenging was the use of statistics. I became aware of this because at the beginning I intuited certain things that were not similar with the use of statistics.
I was able to understand that it is necessary to base ourselves on techniques and methods of data analysis in order not to make mistakes, because if we make analyses on our own, we run the risk of falling into personal or empirical analyses that are not exactly correct.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Personally I do not think there are limitations, we have enough tools for a basic analysis such as the one for the fiscal year and to see what range of funding we need to go to and not pass it.
I think that if we want to do an analysis after 2017 it could represent a limitation.
I would have liked to see the country where the campaigns are from. That could give us data of how people of different countries choose ways to finance themselves.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Maybe, it will be interesting see which currency represents more and less movement in the platform (investment), so with this information the owners can focus the attention on other kind of clients.
